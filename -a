I've reviewed the uncommitted changes in `documentation/TASKS.md`. The diff shows two changes:

1. **Line 157**: Task 1.3.5 status changed from `[C:3]` to `[x]` - This appears to be correcting the task completion marker to the standard completed format.

2. **Line 177**: Task 1.4.1 status changed from `[ ]` to `[C:2]` - This marks Task 1.4.1 as being worked on (likely a custom status indicator showing cycle/iteration 2).

**Analysis:**

These are documentation status updates in a task tracking markdown file. There are:
- **No bugs** - These are simple status marker changes
- **No security issues** - No code changes, just documentation
- **No performance problems** - Documentation only
- **No code style issues** - The markers follow the existing pattern in the file

The changes appear to be legitimate task status updates reflecting work progress. The `[C:2]` notation seems to be a custom format used in this project (similar to `[C:3]` seen elsewhere in the file, and `[~]` for partial completion).
